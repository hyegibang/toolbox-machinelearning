1. What is the general trend in the curve?
  * The general trend in the curve is that the accuracy and percentage has a direct relationship, as one increases the other also increases

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
  * Yes, the data is noisier in the beginning where small population of data is in the trained data, which decreases the accuracy of data. 

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
  * Having num_trial at 500 resulted a smooth curve

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10** -10)). What happens? If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
   * As C value increases, the graph got smoother, indicating an increase in accuracy.
